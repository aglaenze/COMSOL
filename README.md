# COMSOL
Garfield project for ion back flow simulation (IBF) in a Micromegas detector

For more details look at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1y05BzpoZSenbcIpKmfioo0CFtZaqDmReeGPT6FDoHwY/edit?usp=sharing

Don't forget to change in the source code the unit length (in ComponentComsol.cc) --> it has to be in um and not m, replace 100.0 with 1.e-4



## How to use

1) Create a file input.txt, that contains the variables: gas name, model number, ... (see further example of input.txt)

And then
./signal HV1 HV2 HV3 ... + saveNum
3) root -l -q "AddSignalTrees.C($modelNum, \"$gasName\", $hvList)" to add the signal root files
4) root -l -q "Convolute.C($modelNum, \"$gasName\", $hvList)" to convolute the gain obtained in signal root files with the spectrum of Fe (obtained with ./spectrumFe55, see Description of macros)
5) root -l -q "Analyse.C($modelNum, \"$gasName\", $hvList)"



## Description of macros in there

- WhatPossibilities.sh: says which electric field configuration exist for one given model, or for all models
To use: ./WhatPossibilities.sh $modelNum (for one model only)
or just ./WhatPossibilities.sh for all models

- ComputeSignal.sh: automatically starts ./signal for the different electric configurations of a model, by chunks of 4

- parameters.C: contains geometry characterization of each model of detector, simulated with COMSOL

- plotField : to draw electric field + voltage in the detector: broad view + zoom view on the amplification region
To use: First change input.txt with right variables, then make; ./plotField HV1 HV2 HV3 ...

- avalanche: to draw one avalanche signal, started by one electron in the drift region
To use: First change input.txt with right variables, then make; ./avalanche HV1 HV2 HV3 ...

- spectrumFe55: simulates nEvents photons that convert into electrons in the detector, then stores the number of primary electrons produced in a TH1 in a rootfile
[update] also stores in a TH1 the proportion of photons that converted, as a function of the thickness of the detector
To use: make; ./spectrumFe55

- signal: simulates the signal generated by avalanches started by one electron, and stores the number of secondary electrons + ibf ratio + current signals (and their integrals) in TTrees
To use: First change input.txt with right variables, then make; ./signal HV1 HV2 HV3 ... saveNum

- Convolute.C: convolutes the number of secondary electrons (obtained by counting and by extracting the number of charges) with the number of primaries. Output = histograms of amplified Fe spectra

- PhotonConversionRatio.C: to draw the proportion of photons that converted in the detector as a function of the thickness of the detector, and compare it to the theoretical calculation using the cross section (not found! --> find the cross section of photon at 5.9keV in Ar to finish this)

- _Utils.C contains a few useful functions and _Data.C contains data for ZZBOT (simple Micromegas) to compare with simulations

For model1 only:
- GetGain.C: takes the output files of Convolute.C to get the gain of the spectra

- GetIbf.C: take the output files of signal or feSignal to read the currents on the pad electrode and the drift electrode and compute the ibf





## In the folder unused (you should NOT use it):

To compute gain and IBF by counting the electrons and ions:

To draw the gain:
1) ./gain
2) root -l -q Convolute.C
3) root -l -q Analyse.C

To compute the IBF:
1) ./ibf
2) root -l -q Analyse.C

- drawGeometry : draws a geometry of solid boxes (shape of the detector) in 3D, kind of useless

- feSignal: simulates the Fe source with a given rate of events, then the photons convert into primary electrons, each of which then starts an avalanche [takes too long]

- GetNumberOfCharges.C: takes in input the signal root files. It looks at the current = f(time); each time the current goes above a threshold, it'a a new event. For each event, it integrates the current above the thrshold to extract the number of charges (should correspond to the gain)

- Analyse.C : uses the root files previously generated with gain.C and ib.C to analyse the data
--> fit gain and ibf
--> draw gain and ibf curve
--> compare with real data

- GetIbf.C: to get IBF by looking at 1D distribution of current --> gives an underestimated IBF

## Example of input.txt

modelNum = 18
gasName = Ar-iC4H10     # Ar-iC4H10 or Ne or Ar-CO2
nEvents = 500	        # number of events to simulate
computeIBF = 1          # if false, it will only compute the number of amplification electrons in the avalanche (in signal.C)
